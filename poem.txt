The winds of change are blowing strong
It's time to leave the past and move along
With every gust, a new beginning
A chance to grow, to start winning
Change can be scary, that's for sure
But it's what we need to find a cure
For the things that hold us back
And keep us from staying on track
It may require us to take a leap
And leave the comfort of what we keep
But with each step, we'll gain new ground
And the strength to turn things around
So let's embrace the winds of change
And trust the journey won't be strange
For with each gust, we'll find our way
And live to see a brighter day.
